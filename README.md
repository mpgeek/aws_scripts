# AWS Script
The AWS cloud compute platform is very popular and used by tens of thousands of companies daily. Some times a little help is all we need. 

## Why?
Let's face it, there are some aspects of AWS that still rough around the edges. The CLI tools provided by Amazon are often... lacking. Provided here are scripts which *I* find useful when working with AWS. Some of them are original, others are modfications to those found elsewhere or provided to me by others.

## Environment
### **OS**
As much as possible, scripts are designed to work on both MacOS and Linux (AmazonLinux/CentOS).

### **Shells**
These scripts are designed and tested to work with both `bash` and `zsh`. I have heard that most work out-of-the-box with `fish`, but are untested there.

## Improve
